Rock Paper Scissors game

There are five rounds. 

You score a point for each round you win.  The computer scores a point for each round you lose.  No one scores a point for a round that is a draw.

After five round, the winner is declared.

Notes

Updated from the console only version.

Added JS functionality to manipulate the DOM and CSS to style the app.  I've deliberately kept it simple to look at and play.
